              Online proctoring services are a key component of fully online learning.
            <p style="text-align:justify;"> These services provide the means for verifying the identity of students at a distance before an assessment and the methods for ensuring that students taking the assessment are not cheating or getting unauthorized support. Online proctoring systems do this by providing access to a proctor via a webcam or by using a combination of technological means such as browser lockdown, voiceprint, and keystroke or other biometrics, or analysis of video generated during an exam.</p>
              <p>RDISL Proctoring as a Service is a state-of-the-art, cloud-based proctoring service. It helps institutes and universities conduct secure online exams within their LMSs, using credible anti-cheating technology and robust security features. The integration is seamless and click of a button.</p>

         <p>
       Online proctored exams are remotely supervised timed exams that use monitoring software and video streaming to prevent and detect suspicious activity. As such, an online proctored exam is like any exam but with an online infrastructure.
         </p>
            <h5 class="mt-3">How Does Online Proctored Exam Software Work? </h5>
<p>Cloud-based systems drive the infrastructure of online proctored exams. The software validates the examinee’s identity before the exams start, and then tracks student activity. Using AI, the software then monitors and analyzes students’ computer screens, webcams, and microphones.

<span class="elementor-icon-list-text">Authentication </span>
    <p>The software begins with authentication. It checks examinees’ identities and monitors suspicious behavior by ensuring students are sharing a screen with video and audio, making impersonation improbable. After proctors have authenticated the examinees’ identities, tests can commence.</p>
</li>
<li class="elementor-icon-list-item">

<span class="elementor-icon-list-text">Real-time Monitoring </span>
    <p>The next step is monitoring students while they take exams. Proctoring algorithms monitor students and flag suspicious behaviors. Scenarios that are flagged include the presence of another person in the exam room, a student’s face out of the frame, distracted movements, and unauthorized devices. It is up to the discretion of the proctor to determine the activities that count as cheating. </p>
</li>
<li class="elementor-icon-list-item">
<span class="elementor-icon-list-icon">
<img src="{% static 'assets/img/im.png' %}" alt="im" class="img-fluid" style="width:30px;height:30px"> </span>
<span class="elementor-icon-list-text">Screen and System Monitoring </span>
    <p>Remote proctors can monitor a student’s on-screen activity. Proctoring software uses anti-cheating solutions such as customized browser settings that prevent digital/on-screen cheating. Such browser-restrictions operate on full screen, preventing students from changing windows or accessing unauthorized applications. Students cannot open tabs/incognito tabs/windows. The proctoring software also blocks copying and pasting and automatically closes unwarranted browser tabs. </p>
</li>
<li class="elementor-icon-list-item">
<span class="elementor-icon-list-icon">
<img src="{% static 'assets/img/im.png' %}" alt="im" class="img-fluid" style="width:30px;height:30px"> </span>
<span class="elementor-icon-list-text">Data Storage and Review</span>
    <p>The exam software stores the audio and video recordings on the cloud for authorities to review. This reduces the chance of candidates cheating as the software records all activities for later inspection. It also provides an extra layer to the monitoring system. It also reduces the chances of false positives. Data storage also reduces workforce requirement to monitor the exam as proctors can later inspect the recordings in leisure, as opposed to Live proctoring where cases like extended examination duration might require more than one proctor.  </p>

    <h5>Types of Online Proctoring</h5>

    <b>Live Online Proctored Exam</b>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live online proctoring monitors student activities via audio, video, and screen sharing features in real-time. Remote proctors need to be present during the duration of the exam to ensure authentication. If a proctor sees a student cheating, he or she can immediately take action or disqualify the student.</span></p>
<h6><b>Recorded Proctoring</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recorded proctoring does not require human proctors as the software automatically records students’ audio, visuals, and screen in real-time. Proctors can review the recording at any time to check for suspicious activities.</span></p>
<h6><b>Advanced Automated Proctoring</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of proctoring is AI-enabled. Schools and institutions can conduct automated proctored exams without human proctors. There are minimal chances of error as AI detects suspicious activity with greater accuracy than humans, making it the most advanced type of online remote proctoring. </span></p>

    <h2 class="mt-4"><b>Components of Online Proctored Exam </b></h2>

<h6 class="mt-4"><center><img src="{% static 'assets/img/hg.jpg' %}" alt="im" class="img-fluid" ></center>
    <br> <br>
    <b >Authentication
    </b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authentication is the first step before an exam starts. Students need to validate their identity by using biometrics or identity cards and facial recognition technology. Students can register and take the exam after they clear this step. </span></p>
<h6 class="mt-4"><b>Secure Browsing </b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a student browses from the test window or tries to open a window, the secure browser feature stops the test. It blocks the screen of the student, as well as functions such as copy-pasting and restricted keys like Alt+Tab-. The software also detects if a student has synced their device. After detection, it will not let the exam start or terminate the exam immediately and log the candidate out of the software.</span></p>
<h6 class="mt-4"><b>Proctoring</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While an exam is in progress, the software checks for unwarranted activities. AI-based facial recognition and detection checks continuously scan and give alerts or warnings when it detects anomalies, while the remote proctor monitors the candidates through Live video and audio streaming.</span></p>
<h6 class="mt-4"><b>Report Generation</b></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A comprehensive report and analytics provide evidence to prove instances of cheating or unfair activities. Analytics automatically mark students who generated a high number of alerts. Examiners can then use video and audio playback to verify these occurrences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both proctors and students receive reports which include students&#8217; performance, and in most cases, a percentage, percentile, and sectional summary.</span></p>
